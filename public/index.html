    <h1>Web Worker Example</h1>
    <p>
      This example demonstrates how to use web workers, a HTML5
      technology that allows for parallel threads to be run
      by a webpage.  Essentially, a new thread running a JavaScript
      interpreter is spawned for each web worker, which can communicate
      with the main thread (the browser's main JavaScript interpreter)
      through message passing.
    </p>
    <h2>Long-Running Process</h2>
    <p>
      One of the primary uses of web workers is to move long-running
      processes out of the main thread.  This is important as the
      main thread is used for event handling.  If a long-running process
      is running there, it blocks event handling until it finishes.
      The browser quits responding and may even inform the user that
      a script is misbehaiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see this with the process triggered by the button below,
      which creates a permutation of n items:
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="n">Number of permutations to generate:
        <input name="n" id="n" type="number"/>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>
      <button id="permute-in-main">Calculate in Main Thread</button>
      <button id="permute-in-web-worker">Calculate in Web Worker</button>
      <button id="clear-permutations">Clear Permutation Data</button>
    </p>
    <strong id="permutation-message"></strong>
    <ul id="permutation-results">
    </ul>

    <h2>Message Passing and Data</h2>
    <p>
      With webworkers, each thread has its own area of memory where
      variables and objects are stored.  This memory area is inaccessible
      to the other threads.  This is important for keeping our code
      thread-safe - if the other threads could access a thread's memory
      we'd need to implement synchronization constructs like locks and
      semaphores to ensure that no thread was reading data that another
      thread was writing to.
    </p>
    <p>
      To communicate between threads, we use <i>message passing</i>.  The
      messages are added to the thread's event queue, and processed just
      like other events are.  The contents of the message are therefore
      <i>copied</i> into the memory space of the recieving thread.  For
      small and simple messages (like the <strong>n</strong> parameter for
      our permutation function), this works very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other cases, this may become prohibitive.  Say we want to change
      a color image to be grayscale.  To run this process in a webworker,
      we'd need to copy the whole image data to the other thread, and copy
      it back once complete.  The copying process will take some time to
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      One possibility would be to break our image data into chunks, and
      process the chunks independently.  Since the chunks are smaller,
      the copying will happen faster, so we have less issues with blocking
      the main thread.  Click on the images below to try this.
